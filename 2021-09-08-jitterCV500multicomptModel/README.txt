Here, we try to see if the a smaller compartment or AIS leads to higher CV500 and jitter slope.

Files:
1. jitterCV500calc.py - calculates jitter and CV500 of the model provided.

We take a multicompt model with channels in AIS. Then,


1. Inject and record from soma
2. Inject and record from AIS


Does CV500 and jitter change when instead of 150pA, 200pA current is injected in single compt model.

Does CV500 and jitter change when soma size is small?
