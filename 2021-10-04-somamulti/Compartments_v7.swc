#This will get parsed properly in MOOSE only. NEURON will parse it differently.
#5 compartments. soma area is 975e-12m**2. Its dimensions should be 23e-6m length and 13.5e-6m diameter. But since due to parsing issues in MOOSE, the current dimensionas are 17.6e-6m lenght and diameter. the curved surface area of the soma remains the same.
#v3: removed axon
#v5: changing diameter to get proper cell capacitance and input resistance
#v7: Soma dimensions changed so that soma area is around 572e-12m**2
