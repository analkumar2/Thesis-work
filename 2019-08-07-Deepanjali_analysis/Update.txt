I was calculating Rin and Cm from the 25pA and -25pA current clamp charging curve. Deepanjali had calculated these values from voltage clamp data (+5mV). The following are the actual values Deepanjali got:

Input resistance:

WT - 136Mohms

FXS - 121Mohms

Capacitance

WT - 105pF

FXS - 116pF
